  <div class="header content centered">
  <h1>hero shot</h1>
  <p>
    Takes out 80% of the view, and includes a hero shot as a silhouette, looking over a scene.
    <a href="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_ku-large/z9cef5lz7hssjphmkzda.gif"  target="_blank">example from quest for glory</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Some ideas:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>blade runner: silhouette of a hero in a coat moving in the wind, looking from a balcony over a futuristic city with neon lights</li>
    <li>
      Western style: silhouette of the hero looking over a deset mountain scene in the sunrise\sunset if a small city underneath 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is an animated shot with two parts: loop of hero with view, and hero starts walking out of the scene (and into the nest section of the site)
  </p>
</div>
<div class="main-section content centered">
  <h1>Main section</h1>
  <p>This part can be as long as we want. and can be devided to sub-sections.</p>
  <div class="city-start centered">
    <h3>City entrance</h3>
    <p>The hero walks down the screen in a "top view" of the city. The hero is walking on a set path, and following key points on screen based on the scroll position of the site (the user controls the hero by scrolling)</p>
    <p>All other animations are loops, or interact with the user walking (getting to certain key points). This can be birds flying away from the roads, villagers walking or selling things</p>
    <p>The hero passes three points that have text attached to them, looking like an old pokemon\adventure game (either just text or text with faces like <a href="http://sierraplanet.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/glory10.gif" target="_blank">king's quest</a>), each point has a memory cloud with a small animation inside (like clanking drinks)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="city-1st-wall centered">
    <h3>Hero is ready</h3>
    <p>At this point, our hero is ready for the adventure and starts leaving the city.</p>
    <p>First "wall" he passes through (anything that covers most of the width of the view), should have the top X repositories as flags or grafitti or whatever</p>
  </div>
  <div class="city-2nd-wall centered">
    <h3>2nd wall</h3>
    <p>Should contain top X users</p>
  </div>
  <div class="city-3rd-wall centered">
    <h3>3rd wall</h3>
    <p>Should contain top X organizations</p>
  </div>
  <p>Hero walks out of frame...</p>
</div>
<div class="monster-shot content centered">
  <h1>Monster Shot</h1>
  <p>Takes out 100% of the view</p>
  <p>Another "Hero Shot" section. Here, when the user scrolls, it effects the prespective of the shot, as if the camera man is moving from a bottom shot to a top shot</p>
  <p>The Hero is standing with his back to the camera on top of some view point, and when the user scrolls, a monster is revealed as the shot angle changes</p>
</div>
<div class="call-to-action content centered">
  <h1>Call to action</h1>
  <p>Should contain a button to sign up or start using achievibit.</p>
  <p>
    Can contain some sort of additional cliff hanger or just be on top of the monster shot (the button that is).
  </p>
</div>
<div class="footer">
