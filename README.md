# achievibit-storyboard
storyboard for graphical artists to see the general story for the homepage.

Basically, this homepage is like an interactive, moving comic book.
Since achievibit adds a game layer to writing and reviewing code changes, it will be especially neat to make the art in 8-bit style games or old video games (RPG, quests..).

Here's a WIP to test out some of the concepts from this storyboard, with general images as placeholders for things that needs to be drawn: [check it out here](http://kibibit.io/achievibit-demo).
